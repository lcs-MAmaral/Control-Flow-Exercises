 # Introduction
 
 The purpose of this playground is to check your knowledge of concepts from these sections of *App Development with Swift*:
 
 * 1.4: Control Flow
 
 While you complete this playgroud, commit your work (ideally after every question).
 
 This makes it easier to find specific code examples that you can in turn easily add to your Computer Science portfolio.
 
 Students who add links to their Computer Science portfolio will receive individual feedback from Mr. Gordon on how to improve, via GitHub comments (you will receive notifications by emails for any comments made).
 
 If you forget how to add links to your portfolio, [here is a video explaining the process that was shared earlier this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa3Wl3T25jo&list=PLTGGOQnktyWs9TlNJ30pgYgypvIGrt3Lx&index=1).
 
 Remember, the more documentation of learning that you have in your Computer Science portfolio, the more you can justify and expect to earn a top-level grade in this course.
 
 Also, and I hope more importantly, if you learn these fundamental concepts, you are well prepared to begin a project of your choosing in January â€“ be that an app, a game, or some other endeavour.
 
 Ready? Let's begin.
